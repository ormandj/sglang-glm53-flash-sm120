# AIPerf benchmark harness

This directory measures an already-running DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 server. The
client runs inside the serving pod against `127.0.0.1:8000`; the harness never
starts, stops, or restarts the server.

The method deliberately separates three questions:

1. Does the engine execute a fixed decode shape faster?
2. How much useful output does the speculative stack produce?
3. How does the server behave on cold prefill and production-shaped agentic
   traffic?

A separate turnover gate answers a fourth question: how does the scheduler
behave when short requests continuously finish and are replaced at fixed client
concurrency? This path is deliberately excluded from the clean decode plateau,
so both measurements are required for scheduler or admission-policy changes.

[`STATISTICAL-DESIGN.md`](STATISTICAL-DESIGN.md) records why the workloads and
sample counts were selected.

## Pinned implementation

AIPerf is pinned by [`aiperf.lock.json`](aiperf.lock.json). The harness uses
the exact source revision in that file, not a moving package release. Install
that checkout once in the serving pod's persistent tools directory:

```bash
./stage-uv-in-pod.sh /tmp/uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz \
  /models/.bench-tools/uv-0.12.3-linux-x86_64
./prepare-in-pod.sh /tmp/aiperf \
  /models/.bench-tools/aiperf-0.12.0-6ed4823d
```

The committed configs accept both authenticated and keyless endpoints.
`BENCH_API_KEY` takes precedence, followed by the container-provided
`SGLANG_API_KEY` or `VLLM_API_KEY` for the selected engine. With none set, no
authorization header is sent. Keys, arbitrary environment variables, internal
endpoint names, and registry credentials are not captured.

## Controlled engine gate

Every decode cell uses the same workload:

- OpenAI chat-completions endpoint with streaming;
- synthetic coding prompt, 16,384 requested input tokens;
- 4,096 output tokens, `ignore_eos=true` and `min_tokens=4096`;
- temperature 0, top-p 1, and a fixed seed panel;
- exact occupancy at C1, C2, C4, C8, C16, and C32 where supported;
- analysis over the same 17,408–20,480 average-context interval.

The primary engine rate is the OLS slope of server-side decode forward passes.
Synthetic fixed-window output rate and output tokens per forward per request
are reported beside it so speculative-acceptance variation remains visible.
Synthetic output rate is not expected production, interactive, or application
throughput. Every repetition also
records the mean, median, minimum, and maximum DSpARK acceptance rate and
accepted draft length; the summary describes those run-level values without
pooling them. SGLang uses its acceptance gauges. vLLM uses the deltas of its
cumulative draft, draft-token, and accepted-token counters between adjacent
server-metric scrapes; the per-run record also retains each whole-window
counter ratio. The analyzer rejects a window with queueing, prefill work,
counter resets, wrong occupancy, or an insufficient equal-context interval.

Client metrics are retained in the machine-readable summary, not substituted
for the server-side plateau. AIPerf computes ITL for each request as
`(request latency - TTFT) / (output tokens - 1)`. It is the average
post-first-token time per generated token, including speculative acceptance and
scheduler effects; it is not a distribution of literal streamed-chunk gaps.
Request latency is the end-to-end completion time for the fixed 16K-input/4K-
output request and is a secondary integrated workload measurement.

TTFT is retained as raw input to the prefill calculation and for bounds
validation. It is not scored or published as a separate performance result.
For these long prompts it primarily restates prefill speed, while decode-sweep
TTFT additionally mixes prefill and concurrent scheduling.

For each latency metric, the summary preserves each run's average and
p50/p90/p99, then summarizes those run-level values without pooling requests
across repetitions.

Cold prefill uses one output token, temperature 0, top-p 1, an explicit cache
bust, and 8K/32K/64K/130,816-token input targets. SGLang is flushed at the cell
boundary. The vLLM r33 analyzer instead requires its cached-prompt counter to
remain zero because that deployment does not expose the development cache-reset
API. Throughput is observed input tokens divided by TTFT. Only the resulting
prompt-token rate is used for comparison and publication.

## Gate sizes

All cells run sequentially on one unchanged server process. Each distinct shape
is warmed once before any timed cell. There is no restart or per-repetition
warmup.

| Mode | Decode panel | Cold-prefill panel | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `exploratory-decode` | C1/C2/C4/C8 x3 | none | bounded decode-candidate screen |
| `quick` | C1/C4/C8 x3 | 8K/32K/64K/128K x3 | fast candidate screen |
| `decode-supplement` | C2/C16 x3 | none | fill scale guardrails after a quick run |
| `repeat-c2-c4` | C2/C4 x5 | none | confirm a suspicious mid-concurrency result before proceeding |
| `repeat-c8` | C8 x5 | none | replace a precommitted suspicious C8 publication cell with a complete fresh cell |
| `prefill-quick` | none | 8K/32K/64K/128K x3 | matched prefill-only comparison |
| `qualification` | C1/C2/C4/C8 x5; C16/C32 x3 | all lengths x5 | release decision |
| `publication` | every supported C x5 | all lengths x5 | uniform public table |

C1 is the primary single-user programming workload. C2/C4/C8 cover ordinary
sub-agent fan-out. C16/C32 are scale and regression guardrails. The retained
`exploratory-decode` mode makes the project screening rule executable without
changing any decode cell, warmup, analyzer, or retained-control comparison.
The retained
vLLM r33 measurements used the upstream-documented
[`local-inference-lab/rtx6kpro` TP2 fixed-K5 profile](https://github.com/local-inference-lab/rtx6kpro/blob/master/models/ds4dspark-v20-r33.md)
without modifying its serving limits. C32 is recorded as unreachable under
that profile rather than assigned a synthetic value: the recipe sets
`max_num_seqs=16`, and vLLM independently reported a 143,599-token KV pool at
startup. The fixed 16,384-input/4,096-output C32 shape requires roughly
655,000 KV tokens. These are profile-specific limits, not vLLM engine-wide
limits.

Use `repeat-c2-c4` only when a completed panel produces a suspicious C2 or C4
result that must be checked before more expensive scale cells. It creates an
independent five-run panel and never replaces, merges with, or silently extends
the original publication result set.

Use `repeat-c8` only when the release owner commits before execution to replace
the complete C8 publication cell. All five new repetitions replace all five old
repetitions regardless of outcome; keep the original cell as superseded evidence.

Run an engine gate inside the selected pod:

```bash
BENCH_IMAGE_REF='image@sha256:...' \
BENCH_GITOPS_REVISION='<deployment revision>' \
BENCH_PROJECT_REVISION='<this repository revision>' \
AIPERF_REVISION='6ed4823d127b3a6d12c63fb8c2ca5eff13f9ba23' \
BENCH_MODEL_REVISION='<model snapshot revision>' \
BENCH_ENGINE=sglang \
./run-engine-gate-in-pod.sh <campaign> <build> qualification
```

Set `BENCH_ENGINE=vllm` for vLLM. `BENCH_DP_SIZE` defaults to one and should
match a genuinely data-parallel deployment; it is not the tensor-parallel
size.

The output includes raw AIPerf request/server/GPU exports, exact inputs and
config, the analyzer results, `summary.json`, environment provenance, and a
checksum inventory. Performance value is never an exclusion rule.

## Turnover and refill gate

[`run-turnover-gate-in-pod.sh`](run-turnover-gate-in-pod.sh) runs unique,
cache-busted synthetic coding requests: 16 at C1/C2/C4 and 32 at C8. This gives
at least four replacement waves per cell without turning the structural
scheduler check into another long throughput sweep. Every request has a
256-token input target and a forced 256-token output at temperature 0. AIPerf
keeps the client side closed-loop: when one request finishes, another is
submitted until the cell's request set is complete.

The analyzer requires the complete successful request set, exact input/output
shape, sustained target client occupancy while requests remain to be admitted,
the requested peak server occupancy, bounded queue depth, an exact match between
the expected request count and the server's chat-completion POST counter, and
valid server metrics. The client intervals define the concurrency contract.
SGLang's running gauge can temporarily exceed that client concurrency because
finished requests remain visible until scheduler cleanup. It may not exceed
the complete submitted request set, and the exact HTTP request count rejects
untracked traffic.
Terminal drain is reported but is not misclassified as a loss of client load.
The gate reports aggregate output tokens/s, median TTFT, median ITL,
running/queued occupancy, total prefill passes, and effective requests per
prefill pass. The latter is valid for this short, one-pass prompt shape and must
not be compared with a different prompt or chunking method.

The `release-screen` mode runs C8 three times and is the routine turnover check
for an engine-changing public release. The broader `screen` mode runs three
repetitions at C1/C2/C4/C8. `qualification` and `publication` run five at every
concurrency. Use the full `publication` panel when the candidate changes
scheduler, admission, batching, or refill behavior; integrates a new
upstream-main source baseline; or produces a suspicious C8 release screen. A
packaging- or documentation-only release may reuse evidence only when the exact
immutable engine candidate and runtime configuration were already qualified.
All repetitions run on one unchanged server process after one unmeasured,
closed-loop request set per concurrency. The warmup uses the same request count
and shape as a measured repetition so replacement-prefill paths and their
shape-specialized kernels are exercised before timing. Run turnover immediately
after the engine panel without restarting the server so the short screen reuses
the existing serving session while retaining separate metrics and artifacts.

Run it inside the selected pod with the same provenance variables as the engine
gate:

```bash
BENCH_IMAGE_REF='image@sha256:...' \
BENCH_GITOPS_REVISION='<deployment revision>' \
BENCH_PROJECT_REVISION='<this repository revision>' \
AIPERF_REVISION='6ed4823d127b3a6d12c63fb8c2ca5eff13f9ba23' \
BENCH_MODEL_REVISION='<model snapshot revision>' \
./run-turnover-gate-in-pod.sh <campaign> <build> qualification
```

For the routine engine-change screen, replace `qualification` with
`release-screen`. This runs only C8 x3. Do not use it when the full-panel
conditions above apply.

Turnover is its own regression dimension. A gain here cannot erase a decode or
prefill regression, and a clean decode plateau cannot excuse a turnover
regression.

Compare two matched summaries without collapsing their dimensions:

```bash
uv run compare_turnover_gates.py \
  /path/to/baseline/summary.json \
  /path/to/candidate/summary.json
```

Positive throughput or requests-per-prefill-pass changes mean higher values;
positive TTFT or ITL changes mean slower latency.
The comparator rejects different modes, cell sets, request shapes, and
repetition IDs.

## Production-shaped AgentX gate

The controlled engine gate is intentionally deterministic. It does not claim
to reproduce a coding-agent session. For that separate question,
[`agentx-mvp.yaml`](configs/agentx-mvp.yaml) uses AIPerf's date-pinned
InferenceX AgentX MVP scenario with its public Weka coding traces:

- temperature 1.0 and top-p 0.95;
- fixed random and sampling seeds;
- C1 and C8 as separate 900-second minimum runs;
- built-in warmup, replay timing, cache behavior, and submission-validity
  checks.

Run it inside the pod:

```bash
BENCH_IMAGE_REF='image@sha256:...' \
BENCH_GITOPS_REVISION='<deployment revision>' \
BENCH_PROJECT_REVISION='<this repository revision>' \
AIPERF_REVISION='6ed4823d127b3a6d12c63fb8c2ca5eff13f9ba23' \
BENCH_MODEL_REVISION='<model snapshot revision>' \
./run-agentx-gate-in-pod.sh <campaign> <build>
```

AgentX results are reported separately. They are not averaged into the fixed
engine gate and cannot turn an engine regression into a pass.

## Execution rules

- Run only when the host has no image build, compiler, profiler, maintenance,
  or unrelated GPU workload.
- Verify the immutable image digest, exact server command, model revision,
  driver, and clocks/power state before comparing builds.
- Keep one healthy process unchanged while its panel runs sequentially.
- Warm every shape once after a process start, configuration change, or
  profiler attachment. Do not repeatedly restart between samples.
- Retain every valid measurement. Exclude only objective validation failures.
- Compare like-for-like summaries. Do not splice cells from different modes or
  old methods into one table.

Publication uses only a fresh `publication` panel for each engine. It includes
all five run values plus medians and dispersion, and states unsupported cells
directly.

## Release quality and stability checks

These checks are reported separately from the engine-performance panel. They
do not count as additional decode repetitions.

### GSM8K

[`gsm8k.yaml`](configs/gsm8k.yaml) runs the complete 1,319-question GSM8K test
set once at concurrency 16, temperature 0, seed 42, and a 16,384-token response
cap. Accuracy is `correct / 1,319`; this is a dataset accuracy check, not an
`n=5` timing cell.

The pinned AIPerf GSM8K grader prefers the dataset's `####` answer marker. A
response without that marker is recorded as `unparsed` when the documented
last-number fallback is used. A fallback-extracted answer can still be correct,
so the correct count and fallback count are separate facts.

Run it from the serving pod with the same provenance variables as the engine
gate:

```bash
AIPERF_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/path/to/quality-results \
GSM8K_REQUESTS=1319 \
GSM8K_CONCURRENCY=16 \
GSM8K_MAX_TOKENS=16384 \
./run-in-pod.sh configs/gsm8k.yaml gsm8k-full
```

### Near-context and AgentX

[`../near_context_bench.py`](../near_context_bench.py) sends one persisted-corpus
request near the configured context limit. Its authorization header is omitted
when the selected API-key environment variable is unset.

[`run-agentx-gate-in-pod.sh`](run-agentx-gate-in-pod.sh) runs the pinned AgentX
MVP scenario for 900 seconds each at C1 and C8 with temperature 1.0 and top-p
0.95. It requires AIPerf's `submission_valid` result and writes a checksum
inventory on success.

## Optional targeted diagnostics

[`../long_write_quality.py`](../long_write_quality.py) issues sequential
single-file HTML/JavaScript requests and validates their structure and inline
JavaScript. It is not part of the recurring release or publication protocol;
run it only when investigating long-generation behavior. See the tool's
`--help` output for its run and validation commands.
